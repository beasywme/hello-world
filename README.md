Just My First Time
# I am a android junkie.  Unfortunately I' m not the most clever android junkie. Whatever for and why you may ask that it is I say it like so?  Because i have went through my androids settings and royally destroyed things time and time again and again.  jus let ne go bored.  So here I am.  Thought I'd take my boredem out on here for a change and try to learn a thing or two in the process.  Wish me Luck?  Nine x's  

I've been asked to write a commit message describing the changes Ive made. Didnt realize I've made changes to make note of.  Uess of course y'all are referring to this paragraph or two.  I just answered my own question didnt I?  Lets hope so, cause if not, then the instructions that yall have given me arent quite efficient.
